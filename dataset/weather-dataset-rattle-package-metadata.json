With this dataset, you can predict **next-day rain** by training classification models on the target variable **RainTomorrow**. \n\n### Content\nThis dataset comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia. \n\n**RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It answers the crucial question: will it rain the next day? (Yes or No).**\n- This column is marked \u0027Yes\u0027 if the rain for that day was 1mm or more. \n\n### Source \u0026 Acknowledgements\nThe observations were gathered from a multitude of weather stations.
